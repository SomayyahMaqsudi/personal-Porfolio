## Developer Portfolio:
This project is a developer portfolio that allows potential employers to sample a developer's previous work. When loaded, the portfolio presents the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about the developer, their work, and how to contact them.

## User Story:
As a potential employer, I want to be able to view a developer's portfolio, so that I can see their previous work and determine if they are a good fit for my organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
When I load the portfolio, I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
When I click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When I click on the link to the section about the developer's work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
When I am presented with the developer's first application, that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
When I click on the images of the applications, I am taken to that deployed application.
When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
